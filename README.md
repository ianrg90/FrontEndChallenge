Problem description

Imagine that you were hired to develop a WEB application to answer general knowledge questionnaires. When accessing the page, the user must choose the number of questions he wants to answer. After choosing, a page should appear with two buttons, “Start” and “Cancel”. When selecting “Cancel”, you must return to choose the quantity. When selecting "Start" you must make a request at the URL provided, get the questions and for each question, you must display the answers. The user must choose an answer and each answer must count the number of hits and errors. At the end, there should be a report with the number of successes and errors and a list of each question and which was right and which was wrong. In this list the chosen answer and the correct answer must also appear. The score must be stored in localStorage. On the first page and if there is a survey saved in localStorage, you should be able to review the report.
